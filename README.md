# POINTY-DIT212

## Game epic
Pointy [temporary name] is a topdown 2D game. The player is a simple geometrical shape which navigates a hostile, equally geometrical, world. In this world, the player is attacked by various hostiles which shoot different kinds of projectiles at the player. The player itself has no weapon,but a set of abilities which (with some creativity) can be used to defeat the enemies. Some of these abilities are *reflection* (reflecting enemy projectiles), *chockwave* (pushing enemies away), *time manipulation* (slowing down time around the player) and *dash* (making the player invulnerable and very fast for a short period of time). 

The map contains different neutral elements, such as walls, spikes and traps, which can both be dangerous for the player, or cleverly used to aid the player in their mission. 

The goal of the player is to defeat all the elements, reach the map exit, or perform a specific task.
