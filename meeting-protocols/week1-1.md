    1. Decide on project
    2. Github setup
    3. GUI framework.

## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
    1. We are going to make a topdown 2D game. The player objective is to defeat a set of enemies that will attack the player with various projectiles. The player will have no (direct) attack of its own, but will be able to manipulate enemy projectiles, or the map at large, to overcome its enemies. Examples of such methods might be reflecting projectiles, pushing enemies into each other, walls, or map elements, or manipulating the time or gravity of the map. We have discussed this idea and all agreed that it could be a fun and interesting project to work on.

    2. Joachim will create a github repository and invite everyone as collaborators. 

    3. We will look into opejfx and libgdx and decide which one to use for our project.

## Wrap up
Next meeting: 2020-09-04, 14:00, after supervision session.
