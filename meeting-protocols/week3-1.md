## Objectives (5 min)

* Add more detail to the class diagram. 
* Finish a basic player (and a basic enemy) which can move on the screen.
* Write tests for first classes
* Add GUI sketch to RAD

## Discussion items (35 min)
1. Class diagram
2. Tasks
3. Division of work
4. Implementation
5. Point2D as our Vector2D
6. Trello vs Github projects

## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
1. Oom will update class diagram with an IEntity interface which has a width and a height, and remove size from IPositionable interface.
2. Anton will look through UML diagram and consider if additional descriptions or methods are necessary. 
3. Erik and Simon will break up user stories into more tasks.
4. Joachim will upload menu sketch. 
5. Anton will create IPositionable, IMovable, IEntity, and entity. 
6. For now, we'll just write our names in the title of the task we're doing. For the moment, we'll let everyone know when we start on a task, but one is fairly free to assign themeself to a task. Before pushing, we should make sure the implementation is reasonable, and tests have been made. 
7. We have decided to switch to Trello from github projects, since it will become easier to organize user stories and tasks. Simon and Erik will convert our github SCRUM board to a Trello board.
8. We decided to use Point2D in the javafx library instead of our own Vector2D implementation.
9. Joachim will start on a simple GUI mockup to enable us to test our first implementations of enemy and player.
    - He will also write tasks for this purpose.

## Wrap up
