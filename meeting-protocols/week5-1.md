## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
- We've decided to work with JSON instead of a more visual way of designing levels. Erik will continue working on the parser.

- SDD (todo)
    - Describe system architecture (Anton)
    - Create UML class diagrams for every top level package (Mattias and Joachim)
    - describe relationship between domain model and design model (Simon)
    - describe persistent data management (Erik)

- Workflow/structure
    - we need to take more responsibility for the "surrounding" tasks, not just coding
    - it's often unclear what one can do, the project is progressing in a way which is not obvious for all team members. It's hard to assign themselves to a particular task. 
    - We need to collectively workout user stories and tasks, to make sure everyone is up to speed. 

- Rework abstractions, it's sometimes difficult to use certain abstractions because they lack functionality. 

## Wrap up
