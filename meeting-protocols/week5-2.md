## Reports (15 min) from previous meeting

- Anton has made a mouse event handler and implemented a direction for the player. He has also made every shape rotatable and described the system architecture in the SDD.

## Objectives (5 min) 

- Finish everything needed for the peer-review hand-in on Friday 2 October.
- Implement the reflect ability.
- Possibly rework the MVC pattern.


## Discussion items (35 min)

- Decide how to present the UML diagrams - as one large image or several small, and what to include in the SDD.
- Describe in the SDD how we have implemented the MVC pattern.
- We still need to flesh out the details of how the MVC pattern is implemented.

## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
- We decided to have individual images for the UML-diagrams and add the detailed design model.
- Erik will find a way to crop all the images needed for the SDD.
- Anton and Mattias will update the UML diagram.
- Joachim will start to describe the implementation of the MVC pattern.
- Simon will describe the relation and dependencies of interfaces in the top level diagram and add the domain model in the SDD.
