# SOCIAL CONTRACT
As a team, we aspire to create an open and well-functioning environment, where every team member is able to communicate their thoughts and feelings. We want our team to value constructive feedback, where both the person giving feedback and the one receiving feedback will try their best to address any concerns that are raised. 

We will accomplish this by having regular meetings where we will try to illuminate possible problems. We all agree to treat each other with respect and listen whenever a team member has something to say. When someone asks for help, we will approach the issue professionally and in a constructive manner. And if we are in a disagreement on something we will treat the other party’s argument in good faith. We trust that they only want what’s best for the team and project.
