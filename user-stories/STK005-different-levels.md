## Description 

As a user, I want a variety of levels, so that the gameplay doesn't become to similair.  


## Confirmation

### Functional

- Can I play on maps that have different structures/enemies/obstacles?

### Non-functional

- Is there an increasing difficulty level as the game progresses?
