## Description 

As a player, I'd like to have a way to transition from one section of the game to another, to get a sense of progression.

## Confirmation

### Functional

- Can I transition to another part of the game, when one part is done?

### Non-functional

Interactivity
- Is the transition interactive, for example, can I move to another part of the map to enter the next game section?

Visibility
- Is the transition to another section of the game visible to me?
