## Description 

As a player, I want there to exist "spikes", or dangerous, static game elements, for me to avoid. This would create more interesting gameplay, especially since also enemies could be hurt by spikes.

## Confirmation

### Functional

- Can I, and enemies, collide with spikes?
- Does the spikes hurt me, or the enemies, when hit?

### Non-functional

Gameplay
- Can I use the spikes to my advantage?

Visibility
- Can I see the spikes, to know how to navigate around them?
